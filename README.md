Welcome to the Steam Big Picture Customizer! This Python program allows you to replace the default Steam Big Picture boot-up movie with your custom WebM file. It's a straightforward way to personalize your gaming experience on Steam. ALL OF THE STEAM ICONS ARE OWNED BY STEAM AND THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES (this is my first actual repository hope it doesn't get taken down)

## Features

- **Replace Default Video:** Easily swap the default Big Picture mode movie with your own WebM video file.
- **Simple Setup:** Customize the script path and launch a batch file to apply your changes.
- **Free and Open Source:** Enjoy full control over your Steam Big Picture experience at no cost.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
